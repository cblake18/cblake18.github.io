            <h2>When I Started</h2>
            <p>
                I started working out when I was 17 years old. I could barely bench press the bar (45 lbs). 
                Now 8 years later, my max is 325 lbs&mdash;a little over 3 plates (45 lbs each) on each side. 
                This is my best lift. Over these years, I've been consistent with my training, going to the 
                gym regularly even when I wasn't motivated.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Going to the gym has showed me the power of consistency. It taught me to stay consistent even 
                when I am not motivated. Some days you don't feel like going, but you go anyway. That's what 
                makes the difference. The gym has become part of my routine and lifestyle.
            </p>

            <p>
                This website documents my workout routines, the exercises I do for each muscle group, and what 
                I've learned about proper form and training over the past 8 years. I'll share my weekly split, 
                favorite exercises, and the importance of focusing on form over weight.

            <p>
                I do a day or two days a week devoted to chest and back, another day for arms (biceps/triceps), 
                another day for shoulders, and lastly a day a week for legs. This split allows each muscle group 
                to recover properly between sessions.

            <h2>Exercise Breakdown by Muscle Group</h2>
            
            <h3>Chest Training</h3>
            <p>
                For chest I like to do barbell bench press. This was the first lift I started consistently 
                trying to improve. I started at 17 years old and could barely do the bar (45 lbs). Now 8 years 
                later my max is 325 lbs. I also like to do very controlled machine bench press&mdash;controlling 
                the descent is very important, not ego lifting. I really like chest flys for chest as well as 
                incline bench for upper chest.
            </p>
            
            <h4>My Chest Exercises:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Barbell Bench Press:</strong> Started with just the bar, now at 325 lbs max</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Bench Press:</strong> Focus on controlled descent, not ego lifting</li>
                <li><strong>Chest Flys:</strong> Great for chest isolation and stretch</li>
                <li><strong>Incline Bench Press:</strong> Targets upper chest development</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Back Development</h3>
            <p>
                For back, pullups are awesome. I also do cable lat pulldown, rows (cable rows, bent-over barbell/dumbell rows, or plate loaded machine rows) and oldschool pullovers&mdash;these 
                are a wonderful compound movement for back, shoulder mobility, triceps, and chest.
            </p>
            
            <table class="exercise-table">
                <caption>Back Exercises</caption>

                    <tr>
                        <th>Exercise</th>

                    <tr>
                        <td>Pull-ups</td>
                        <td>3-4 &times; 8&ndash;12</td>
                        <td>Full stretch at bottom, squeeze at top</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Cable Lat Pulldown</td>
                        <td>3-4 &times; 12&ndash;15</td>
                        <td>Pull with lats, not arms</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Rows (Cable/Bent-over)</td>
                        <td>3-4 &times; 8&ndash;12</td>
                        <td>Focus on back contraction</td>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Pullovers</td>
                        <td>3-4 &times; 15</td>
                        <td>Great for back, chest, triceps, shoulder mobility</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>Arm Training</h3>
            <p>
                For triceps I love doing weighted dips and tricep extensions with a rope/handle bar on the pulley. 
                For biceps, I do sitting bicep dumbbell curls on a leaning back bench&mdash;getting the full bicep 
                stretch here is more important than using high weights. Also close handed bicep focused chin ups 
                are great for biceps.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Triceps:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weighted Dips:</strong> Great compound movement for tricep mass</li>
                <li><strong>Tricep Extensions:</strong> Using rope or handle bar on pulley</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Biceps:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sitting Bicep Curls:</strong> On leaning back bench, focus on full stretch over heavy weight</li>
                <li><strong>Close-Grip Chin-ups:</strong> Bicep focused variation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Shoulder Training</h3>
            <p>
                For shoulders just the basic dumbbell shoulder press, face pulls with a rope for rear delts and 
                reverse delt flys, and lateral raises with dumbbells or pulleys for side delts.
            </p>
            
            <div class="exercise-highlight">
                <h4>Shoulder Movements:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dumbbell Shoulder Press:</strong> Basic movement for overall development</li>
                    <li><strong>Lateral Raises:</strong> Dumbbells or cables for side delts</li>
                    <li><strong>Face Pulls:</strong> Rope attachment for rear delts</li>
                    <li><strong>Reverse Delt Flys:</strong> Important for rear delt development</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Leg Day: The Hardest Day</h3>
            <p>
                Legs are definitely the hardest but cannot be forgotten. Mobility is extremely important for 
                legs and they require so many different muscles to be loose and stretched to have a productive 
                leg workout (glutes, hamstrings, quads, hips, hip flexors, calves, ankles, lower back).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Squats are ideal but they are not always practical if I am tight. I do a lot of hack squats 
                with extreme focus on good form, not worrying about the weight. I also do single leg curls, 
                leg extensions, leg press, hip thrusts. The more you can spread out the work on all of the 
                affected leg muscles the better you will see growth in size and strength in the legs.
            </p>

        <!-- Lessons Learned Section -->
        <section id="lessons">
            <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Progress Isn&rsquo;t Always About Going Up in Weight</h3>
            <p>
                As I have grown more in the gym I have learned progressing my muscles is not always about 
                going up in weight. It's about:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Feeling the movement in the right muscle</li>
                <li>Bringing the movement through the entire range of motion</li>
                <li>Not using the incorrect muscles too much for a movement (like using shoulders for chest movements)</li>
                <li>Controlling the weight, especially on the way down</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Staying Consistent Even When Not Motivated</h3>
            <p>
                Going to the gym has showed me the power of consistency. You have to stay consistent even 
                when you are not motivated. Some days you want to go, other days you don't. Go anyway.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Listen to Your Body</h3>
            <p>
                There's a difference between pushing through a hard workout and pushing through pain. If something 
                doesn't feel right, especially with complex movements like squats, modify or substitute.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Small Gains Add Up</h3>
            <p>
                My bench press went from 45 to 325 pounds over 8 years. That didn't happen overnight. It was 
                small improvements every week, every month, every year. This applies to everything in life.
